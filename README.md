### Towards Computational Biology
I am currently trying to dive into exploiting deep learning to tackle complex biological problems and eventually give people better lives. This may be a long shot, but I will take the odds.  
Here are my projects:
- [ChatMol](https://github.com/JinyuanSun/ChatMol) ![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/ChatMol/ChatMol)  
  - A comprehensive molecular design assistant
- [GROMACS Copilot](https://github.com/ChatMol/gromacs_copilot) ![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/ChatMol/gromacs_copilot)  
  - An AI agent for MD simulations using GROMCAS
- [molecule-mcp](https://github.com/ChatMol/molecule-mcp) ![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/ChatMol/molecule-mcp)
  - A model-context-protocol server for molecules. 
- [PymolFold](https://github.com/JinyuanSun/PymolFold) ![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/JinyuanSun/PymolFold)  
  - Fold and design your protein in pymol.
- [Pythia](https://github.com/Wublab/Pythia) ![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/Wublab/Pythia)  
  - Ultra-fast protein mutation stability prediction. 
- [DDGScan](https://github.com/JinyuanSun/DDGScan) ![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/JinyuanSun/DDGScan)  
  - Score, analysis and visualization of protein mutation(s).
