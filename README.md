# DL4Bio
I am currently trying to dive into DL4Bio, exploiting deep learning to tackle complex biological problems and eventually give people better lives.  
This may be a long shot, but I will take the odds. Starting from some "easy" problem, like enzyme engineering using some well developed software like [rosetta](https://www.rosettacommons.org/) and built some [pipelines](https://github.com/JinyuanSun/DDGScan). I also tried to make some [packages](https://github.com/JinyuanSun/SeqDDG) for enzyme engingeering with baics deep learning methods.  
If you would like to discuss anything about applying deep learning to biological problems, feel free to get in touch with [me](jinyuansun98@gmail.com).
