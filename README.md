# DL4Bio
I am currently trying to dive into DL4Bio, exploiting deep learning to tackle complex biological problems and eventually give people better lives.  
This may be a long shot, but I will take the odds. Starting from some "easy" problem, like enzyme engineering.  
If you would like to discuss anything about applying deep learning to biological problems, feel free to get in touch with [me](jinyuansun98@gmail.com).
